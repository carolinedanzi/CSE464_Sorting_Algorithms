CSE 464 Project One README

This project uses Eclipse Luna with Java 8 (Java SE 1.8)

Using Eclipse Luna, Go to File->Import->Existing Projects into Workspace
Choose "Select root directory" then browse the ProjectOne folder and choose it.

You should see ProjectOne in the PackageExplorer.  
Open the properties for ProjectOne->Java Build Path->Libraries and remove any currently linked JAR files.

Then click on "Add JARs", navigate to the lib folder of ProjectOne and add the two (2) JAR files found there.

Click OK to close the properties window.

In the Package Explorer, go to ProjectOne->src->SortingAlgorithms and double-click the Testing.java file to open.

Finally click the green play button to run the program. The program will take a minute or so to finish computing.
The plot window will appear behind any open applications in the upper left-hand corner of the screen.

If only the red curve is visible on the plot, resize the window until the blue line is visible at the bottom of the plot.
